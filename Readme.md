# Computer Science College Resume Template

This is a LuaLaTeX resume template catered specifically to college students in Computer Science, although it can be adapted to any major or non-students.

## Getting Started

### Using TeX

Download a TeX distribution from the table below:

| Windows | Mac | *nix |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:|
| [TeX Live](http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/install-tl-windows.exe) | [MacTex](http://tug.org/cgi-bin/mactex-download/MacTeX.pkg) | [TeX Live](http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/install-tl-unx.tar.gz) |

TeX is very modular, and depending on the distribution you download, you may or may not have all of the packages needed to typeset the template. TeX Live Utility is a great package manager for Mac. For other systems, you may need to use the command line to install new packages.

It is important to typeset this template using LuaLaTeX rather than LaTeX, XeTeX, etc.
